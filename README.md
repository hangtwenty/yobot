## This is an old Hackathon project

This was a quick project, currently unmaintained. I think it was a fun idea though!

# Yobot

Yobot is a chatbot that introduces people to each other. It's an easy way to make connections
in your growing organization.
 
Yobot is implemented for Slack and ready to 
deploy with AWS Lambda. Low or no maintenance. Likely no cost.

Yobot is an easy way to connect people.
Now, it's nothing revolutionary. It is simple [and unoriginal][1].
But if Yobot helps a few teammates get connected, it's done its job!
The best case is that some people will connect across functions, departments, or geographies. 


# Overview

Just write `/yobot` and you get a random introduction.
When you type `/yobot` you get a private message with someone's
name, username, and an icebreaker prompt. Then you can send them a message, or not. 
Also, nobody sees that you've used Yobot. Easy, and no-pressure. There are more commands,
see below.

## Batteries included

If you're handy with Python and AWS this will take you less than an hour to set up. (You'll
just need Slack admin rights, or a Slack admin ready to grant you some integrations.)

* Implemented with Python calling Slack's excellent APIs.
* **Batteries included.**
Contains deployment script, with instructions in this README, to set up as an AWS Lambda function. 
* **No database.** Obviously easier to set up and maintain this way! But how? Well, Slack
 is the only database needed. [etsy/mixer][1] uses a database to avoid introducing people twice.
 But Yobot is designed to respond on demand. It doesn't introduce people on a schedule,
 so a repeat isn't really annoying. Put yourself in the end-user's shoes: 
 if you already know the person, you can just call `/yobot` again and get another introduction.
* **Function as a Service.** (No need to have an idle server running.)
* Take a look at [AWS Lambda's pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/). Only one request is needed each time someone uses Yobot. Since you will probably not use Yobot more than a million times in a month, it
will probably be free for you to run. Since AWS Lambda removes the need for you to maintain
a server, there is no server you need to keep running.

# Inspired by [etsy/mixer][1], but it's different

[etsy/mixer][1] is an awesome idea:

> [Mixer is] a simple web app that allows people to join a group and then get randomly paired with another member of that group. It then prompts you to meet each other for a coffee, lunch, or a drink after work.  [If you're not both in the same place,] just hop on a video chat.  This encourages people who may not work in the same place to stay in touch and find out what’s going on in each other’s day to day.  The tool keeps a history of the pairings and attempts to match you with someone unique each week; it’s possible to opt in or out of the program at any time.

I love the mixer idea, except I don't like more email.
And I don't think my coworkers want more emails either.

## Differences from [etsy/mixer][1]

The main difference from [etsy/mixer][1] is that Yobot is *serverless* and *databaseless*.
So it should be easier to set up, as well as easier to maintain.

Lastly, by using the API of your company-standard chat client (like Slack),
you can:

* Avoid sending people MORE EMAIL. Hoping people will engage readily on chat, they already "hang out" there.
* Use the [chat user list](https://api.slack.com/methods/users.list) as a directory of employees,
so there is no need to access the company's [directory service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_service)
(no fun), or translate it to another format, or store that directory in a database,
or keep that second directory up to date. Of course we're coupled and limited, 
but I think I spent less time writing this code than I would have to spend, going through
IT to get access to our directory service ... not to mention how hard it would be to 
keep my replica of it up to date, etc. etc.

All that said. Big ups to Etsy Engineering and Mixer as I think it's a brilliant idea.
Clearly an inspiring one!

# Setup

_[We should change the execution model to Flask/Zappa, and do something fairly common/conventional for handling the configuration... things are too custom right now, because when this Hackathon happened, Lambda was pretty new. Plus it was Hackathon. See Issue #1.](https://github.com/hangtwenty/yobot/issues/1)_

## Configuration

### Slack side

Configuration on the Slack side is like most Slackbots ... but ... I should still document -- _[Issue #8](https://github.com/hangtwenty/yobot/issues/8)_

### Yobot side

Out of the box:

    $ cp .env.example .env      # start from template
    $ vim .env                  # edit config and put your secrets in
    # source .env               # before you deploy or test.

To `source .env` every time you `cd` into this directory,
[use autoenv](https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv) (or [autoenv-zsh](https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv)).

Full details ... Take a look at `yobot_config_and_secrets.py` and `.env.example.` The idea is:

* `yobot_config_and_secrets.py` just gets its values from environment variables.
This makes it easy to work with locally, without committing secrets to VCS.
* There are several easy ways to manage these environment variables. Pick your fancy:
    * You make a script that sets the variables, and source it before testing or deploying.
      *Don't commit this to git.*
    * Pass them as arguments. i.e. `YOBOT_BOTUSER_TOKEN=blah YOBOT_BLAH=foobar ./scripts/deploy.sh`
    * Define them in a `~/.bashrc`.
    * If you don't want environment variables at all, just modify your local
        `yobot_config_and_secrets.py` directly and hardcode the values. *Don't commit this to git.*

## Test it out locally

Right now the best way is:

    $ python ./yobot/lambda_function.py

## Deployment

### Serverless, with AWS Lambda (batteries included!)

Here are detailed instructions - but don't be intimidated, *it's easy*.

The idea is that you put Yobot in AWS Lambda behind an API Gateway.

_**[This can be done very easily with Flask/Zappa, see Issue #1](https://github.com/hangtwenty/yobot/issues/1)**_

#### Prereqs:

1. An AWS account
2. Permissions to configure your AWS Account to add 1 AWS Lambda function and 1 AWS API Gateway.
3. The AWS CLI, up to date.

#### Manual, one-time setup with AWS Lambda

_[Holdover, until we replace this after addressing Issue #1.](https://github.com/hangtwenty/yobot/issues/1)_

#### Deployment script

If you followed "Configuration" then this is all it takes:

    $ source .env 
    $ ./scripts/deploy.sh

`deploy.sh` is mostly just [standard steps to deploy Python code and a virtualenv to AWS Lambda](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-python-how-to-create-deployment-package.html)
Plus a little bit to do with config.

There's just one part some people might see as weird. The script will
take the required environment variables (`YOBOT_BOTUSER_TOKEN` etc.) -- the same ones you set
before, in "Configuration" section -- and **hardcode them into the deployment package.**
Specifically, it'll make the zip, then overwrite `yobot_config_and_secrets.py`
with values from environment variables.

Again, the simplest way to do something different is to **directly modify the code.**
Just modify `deploy.sh` to suit your needs, getting config & secrets from wherever you'd prefer.
If you've already hardcoded config & secrets into `yobot_config_and_secrets.py`,
then you could just delete this bit from `deploy.sh`

### Without AWS Lambda (batteries not included, but it'll be easy)

You could run this like a normal long-running bot process. It won't be hard.
Put it behind a web server that can take requests from Slack.
Make your server take a request from Slack. You are only responsible
for processing Slack's incoming POST request and converting it to a dictionary of parameters.
Then you pass that dictionary of parameters to the `handle_slack_request` 
function in `slack_logic.py`. It'll take it all from there.
